## Tomb Raider Utils

Tomb Raider Utils is repo contiaining a list of useful tomb raider tools, from 1 to 5 (including Gold expansios)

## Tomb Raider 1

There's a phd reader for reading TR1 level details (very raw and I'll not continue this script since is too difficult to continue)

## Tomb Raider 2

There's a level reader for reading TR2 level details (work in progress, it should be more easier to develop instead of the TR1 one)

## Tomb Raider 3

For now there's only a partial tombpc.dat reader in python, for the strings of the script of the game.  It should work with TR2 too
